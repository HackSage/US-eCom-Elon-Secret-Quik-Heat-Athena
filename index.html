												<h1><a href="{offer_link}">Elon Musk Reveals the Secret to Staying Warm This Winter... All While Cutting Your Heating Bill to Basically $0.</a></h1>
												<div id="articleDate" class="articleDate">Tue Dec 17 2024 | By Steven Gafferty</div>
												<a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/estage.webp"></a><br>
												<p><b>This hyper-efficient heating technology is how we kept astronaunts warm on trips to the International Space Station. But now thanks to it's famous creator, it's been made public despite the $5 billion dollar heating industry wanting to ban it. With Thousands of 5-Star Reviews and Customers Loving It, Why Not Try It Yourself?</b></p>

												<p>Every winter, I dread the arrival of my heating bill. Despite cranking up the heat, my home never seems to get warm enough. I've tried different heaters, but none of them have been able to heat my home efficiently.</p>

												<p><b>I was tired of spending so much money on heating, only to still feel cold in my own home.</b> I knew there had to be a better solution out there.</p>

												<h1>The Big Lie of The Heating Industry</h1>

												<p>For years, only a few dominant companies controlled the heating industry. They set exorbitant prices and took advantage of unsuspecting Customers.</p>

												<p>Enter SpaceX and Elon Musk, the man who never shies away from shaking up industries. Recognizing the heating industry’s exploitation of consumers, Musk was determined to find a better way.</p>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/espace.webp"></a></p>

												<p>During a scientific conference on space exploration, Musk ran into an old friend, Sam Harper, a lead engineer for the Mars Rover project. Harper was the mastermind behind a unique heating technology originally developed for NASA’s Mars missions.</p>

												<p><b>Sam was the one that created this heating technology for NASA in the first place</b>, and him and Elon got to talking about how the tech was just declassified earlier that week.</p>

												<p>The two found a quiet corner among the party, and after reminiscing and laughing about old memories, the conversation turned serious.</p>

												<p>They found a perfect storm of their own, but this one positive! Sam had been waiting for his top secret heating technology to be available to the public, and Elon was looking for his next big project to help change the world.</p>

												<p>After the drinks and laughs turned serious, <b>they decided they would bring this high-tech heating technology to the public together, at a price that literally anyone could afford...</b></p>

												<h1>And decided they would call it... <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat!</a></h1>

												<p>The name inspiration came from the name of the first mission the tech was used on.</p>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/hm.webp"></a></p>

												<h1>Musk’s Vision Takes Flight!</h1>
												<p>The technology was declassified just before Trump left office, which made the whole thing possible. Elon and his team rushed to get an Quik Heat prototype done in just a couple months, so they could get this out to as many people as possible as soon as possible.</p>

												<p><b>They spent 2021 perfecting <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat,</a> making it more efficient, more compact, and better at heating.</b> They spent months in a warehouse working hard on developing not just a better prototype, but also something they could manufacture at a large scale <b>so that every American that wanted one could have one.</b></p>

												<p>Last Winter they missed being able to get them out in large numbers, but it was worth the wait...</p>

												<p>By March of 2022 Quik Heat was working even better than they had dreamed, and just in time to get produdction up and running to launch all across the United States this winter!</p>

												<p>And they met their goal of being able to <b>provide <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat for about $34.99!</a></b></p>

												<h1>So What Makes Quik Heat so Special Besides the Price?</h1>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/coldhold.jpeg"></a></p>

												<p>The technology insided it is incredibly advanced, but it all comes down to something very simple. <b><a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat</a> uses advanced types of metals in the electronics that were previously unavailable for commericial use,</b> and using the right combination of metals, makes it the most efficient heating device period.</p>

												<p><b>Elon Explains it a little better,
														"It's all about the electronics inside. Normally it takes a lot of electricity to create heat. Without this tech, on the space shuttle we would run out of energy, or in your home, the power bill would go way up like it usually does in the winter."</b></p><b>

													<p>"The materials we use in Quik Heat are the best conductors in the world. Normally you have to force electricity into heat, but since our proprietary conductors have the electrons(electricity) moving so fast on an aSamic level, as soon as they hit the heating plates they instantly turn to heat since they have carried more energy with them."</p>

													<p>"I know that's confusing, but basically it can heat a whole room for a couple pennies per day on your power bill, versus running your central heat which will cost you hundreds of dollars a month this Winter."</p>
												</b>

												<h1>Putting Quik Heat to the Test...</h1>
												<p>We loved the idea, and I've already seen my power bill go way up this October, and it's only been about 45 degrees a couple days so far. Imagine how much worse it's going to get when it actually gets cold!</p>

												<p>I decided to order some directly from the <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat website here</a> to test them out and see how much I could really save this winter.</p>

												<p>When the <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat</a> arrived the first thing I thought was wow, this will be perfect at my desk while working. My office is always the coldest room in the house, so I gave it a try there first.</p>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/underdesk1.webp"></a></p>

												<p>I can't even tell you how perfect that was! It's very powerful and heats the area all around very quickly, but you can set the temperature exactly where you want. I put it at 76 degrees and was blown away when it warmed the whole room.</p>

												<p>Let me tell you, if you are always freezing at the office, you NEED one of these!</p>

												<h1>So How Was it Overall...?</h1>
												<p>Let's just say, after I tested these at my house, I ordered more to get my Christmas shopping done early.</p>

												<p>Before Quik Heat came in, we had to keep our heat on at 77 degrees. Now with one in the living room, and one in our bedroom, we rarely ever use our home's central heating.</p>

												<p>Our bedroom has been staying warm even when it gets down to 45 at night. And we still have it on a low setting so I know it will keep us warm even as it gets colder this year!</p>

												<p>The one in the living room is powerful enough to heat our kitchen too, so <b>in our 1,200sqft house, just two does job and we don't touch the central heat anymore.</b></p>

												<p>This is literally going to save us HUNDREDS of dollars every month this winter. Not to mention it's just even more comfortable all around, because <b>you can have the right amount of heat when you want it, and where you want it.</b></p>

												<p>After all, my office is cold so I will definitely use <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat</a> all year round.</p>

												<p>Plus no weird heating smell that always came from our home's vents!</p>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/kitchenheat3.webp"></a></p>


												<p>On top of how comfortable Quik Heat makes everything, <b>the biggest part for my wife and I is saving money</b>. I've been checking our power bill online and literally haven't noticed any difference besides the huge savings we're already seeing from not running the central heat.</p>

												<p>It really is just like plugging in another lamp or something. You don't even notice an increase in your power bill because it's just a few pennies a day.</p>

												<p>I also sent one to my Mom who lives alone. Many larger space heaters can be dangerous because their chords melt or catch on fire, but no chords here. She loved it just as much as we did too:</p>

												<p><b>“I didn't think something so small and light could work this well. And now I have one at home and one I keep at the office. It’s so safe, I don’t have to worry and love sleeping in it's warmth.”</b></p>

												<p>I'm so glad we got <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat</a> before it got really cold out this year, <b>and already saved a ton of money.</b> Here's a picture from someone in Texas last year when that huge unexpected cold front came and they had no option but to crank up the heat...</p>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/phone.jfif"></a></p>

												<p>Don't get caught without an <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat!</a></p>

												<p>Besides getting one BEFORE you need it, we recommend snapping one up as soon as possible because big power corporations are trying to shut Quik Heat down since it allows anyone to <b>save over $1,000 per year off your power bill.</b></p>

												<p>They want you to use your central heating to heat your entire house all winter, so they can collect hundreds of dollars a month from you at these crazy inflated energy prices!</p>

												<h1>Conclusion: Is it Worth it?</h1>

												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/product1.webp"></a></p>

												<p>Absolutely, yes.

													On top of <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat's</a> high-tech efficiency saving you tons of money, and being safer than a standard space heater, it has any feature you could want.

													Having the heat right where you want, when you want it, and also being powerful enough to heat our whole kitchen and living room, it really is a no-brainer.

													You could heat a whole apartment with one of these, and we just have 2 for our whole house. It's such a deal right now at about $34.99 and all these features.

												</p>
												<p><a href="{offer_link}"><img class="img-responsive" src="./index_files/comparec.webp"></a></p>

												<p> Last year saw record breaking cold across the US, and experts are expecting the same this year. <b>That means huge power bills...</b>

													Now that Elon and his team have <a href="{offer_link}">Quik Heat</a> launched in time for Winter, it is already the number 1 Holiday gift nationwide.

												</p>
												<h1>Quik Heat is Guaranteed And...</h1>
												<p><b>Warms up Every Room</b></p>
												<p>Heating a whole room in just 2 minutes and covering well over the average room it will ensure all corners are heated up this winter.</p>

												<p><b>Save Money on Electricity</b></p>
												<p>Instead of throwing away over $1000 like you do with central heating each winter, you can keep your hard earned money for whatever else you want!</p>

												<p><b>Fit Right Into Your Home</b></p>
												<p>Most space heaters are clunky, big, and ugly. Quik Heat's small and easy to use design plugs right in, and blends in with any room while keeping it toasty, wherever you want.</p>

												<br>
												<h1>What Others Have Said</h1>
												<blockquote><em>"This is the third space heater I’ve tried. All the other ones were either super loud or they got too hot to keep around my kids. The Quik Heat is amazing! It’s so safe and it doesn’t make any noise. It’s great for nighttime."</em><br>
													- Jill B, 59</blockquote>
												<blockquote><em>"The heater arrived really quickly! I was shocked at how small it was, but trust me – this thing works! It keeps the room sooo nice and warm."</em><br>
													- Kenneth C, 62</blockquote>
												<blockquote><em>"I usually plug in the heater in the outlet across the room while I’m studying. The whole room stays perfectly warm all day long, and I can focus a lot better on my work."</em><br>
													- Missy, 29</blockquote>
												<blockquote><em>"I absolutely LOVE this heater. The winters in Erie are almost unbearable! Every year I have to suck it up and pay a massive heating bill. It’s either that or freeze half to death. I decided to try the Quik Heat for a while, and bought it online. I couldn’t believe how powerful it was, especially since it’s so small! It heats up my living room almost instantly, and it even has safety features that other heater has. I can’t believe I’ve gone this long without one. You have to try it!"</em><br>
													- Jim, 36</blockquote>
